# Employee_Tracker

Description

For this challenge we've set out to build a command-line application to manage a company's databse of employees using MySQL, Node.js and Inquirer.  This challenge was particularly motivating as this type of work will certainly have real world application moving forward in a development career.  Once again I was assisted by my instructor Leif Hetland, the TA Fred Kamm, my classmates, and my tutor, Erik Hoversten.

Usage
